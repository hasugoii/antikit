## 🤔 Why AntiKit?

You have **Google Antigravity**, the most powerful AI coding agent. But sometimes it feels...
- 😥 **Too Technical:** "Contexts", "Schemas", "Prompts"... confusing!
- 🇺🇸 **Too English:** You ask in Vietnamese, it replies in English.
- 😨 **Too Risky:** What if it deletes my `C:\Windows` folder?
- 😵 **Too Chaotic:** Who is talking? The coder? The tester?

**AntiKit** fixes all of that. It turns the raw engine of Antigravity into a **Luxury Sports Car** that anyone can drive.

## ✨ The 4 Pillars of "Vibe Coding"

### 1. 🌏 Native Fluency (Speak YOUR Language)
Stop struggling with "Engrish". AntiKit forces the AI to **THINK and SPEAK** in your native language (Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese) 100% of the time.
> *No more: "Here is your code" -> It's now: "Của bạn đây, sếp ơi!"*

### 2. 🛡️ Zero-Fear Safety (Sandbox Mode)
Code with total peace of mind. We installed a **Digital Force Field**:
- 🚫 **Block Destructive Commands:** No `rm -rf` allowed.
- 🔒 **Project Lockdown:** AI cannot touch anything outside your project folder.
- 🧱 **System Protection:** Your OS files are untouchable.

### 3. 🆔 Clarity Badges (Know Your Team)
AntiKit gives every AI agent a name tag. You always know who is working for you.
> `> 🆔 Agent: @architect (Kiến trúc sư) | 🛠️ Skills: Quy hoạch, Thiết kế`

### 4. 🧠 Supervisor Brain (Auto-Correction)
We implanted a "Conscience" into the AI. Before it gives you code, it secretly asks itself:
> *"Wait, is this code good enough? Would a Senior Dev approve this?"*
It fixes its own mistakes **before** you even see them.
